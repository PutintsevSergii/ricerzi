# Daily Prayer of the Knights

O Lord Jesus Christ,
through the intercession of Saint John Paul II,
grant us the grace to be faithful witnesses of Your love
and to serve our brothers and sisters with humility and joy.

Help us to be strong in faith,
generous in charity,
and steadfast in hope.

May we always follow the example of Saint John Paul II,
who showed us how to live the Gospel
with courage and conviction.

We ask this through Christ our Lord.
Amen.
