aboutContent: |
  The Latvian Province of the Order of Knights of Saint John Paul II the Great (Ordo Militiae Sancti Ioannis Pauli II Magni) is part of an international Catholic fraternity of laymen. Founded in January 2011 as a tribute to the beatification of the Great Pope, the Order aims to shape men in the spirit of St. John Paul II — through faith, service, and brotherhood.
  Knights strive for personal holiness, defend Christian values, foster spiritual life among men, support clergy, and cultivate love of country. Their daily lives are meant to be living testimonies of faith — within their families and society at large.
  The Order's structure mirrors that of the Church - the basic unit is a Banner (parish level), followed by a Commandery (diocesan level), and then a Province (national level). The Order is led by a General, elected by representatives of all Provinces and entrusted with full spiritual and organizational authority.
