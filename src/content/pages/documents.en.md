ruleContent: |
  The "Rule" is the foundation of every Knight of Saint John Paul II. It is not merely a set of regulations, but a living witness to how Catholic men choose to live today — upholding spiritual, moral, and social order in a world often drifting from it.
  
  The Rule defines our mission: to be present, vigilant, and active in society, while remaining rooted in the will of God and the teachings of the Church. It describes our form of service, principles of daily conduct, our fraternal relationships, ecclesiastical obligations, internal governance, and personal discipline.
  
  The Rule is built on the following pillars:
rulePillars:
  - 'Spiritual life — daily prayer, participation in the sacraments, and service to the Church.'
  - 'Brotherhood — mutual respect, trust, and responsibility between brothers.'
  - 'Discipline and structure — each brother knows his role and duties within the Order.'
  - 'Catholic manhood — purity, reverence for women, and a spirit of service in both family and community.'
  - 'Protection — our mission includes defending the faith, the sanctity of life from conception to natural death, and the integrity of the family.'

  The Rule is not static. It lives and breathes through the commitment of our brothers, through daily practice, shared formation, and spiritual renewal. It unites us and empowers us to be a light of faith in the world.
